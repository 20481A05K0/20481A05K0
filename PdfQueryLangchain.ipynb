However, most \\nMF methods suffer from the problems of data sparsity, overfitting, and \\nrating inconsistency. This project  a movie recommender system based on \\nfast Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization (MMMF), which is a novel \\nMF method that can overcome these problems by learning user and item \\npreferences from partially observed ratings with a large margin criterion. \\nWe compare our system with other MF methods, such as Singular Value \\nDecomposition (SVD), Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and \\nProbabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF), on two publicly available \\nmovie rating dataset  MovieLens . We evaluate the performance of our \\nsystem using various metrics, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), \\nprecision, recall, and diversity. The experimental results show that our \\nsystem outperforms other MF methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, \\nand diversity of recommendations. We also discuss the advantages and \\nlimitations of our system, and suggest some future directions for \\nimprovement.  \\n \\n \\nTeam  Members  \\n20481A05 K0 \\n20481A05 P5 \\nProject  Guide  20481A0 5O3 \\n(Dr. N.RAJESWARI ) 20481A05 P3 '"

When p = d + 1 − s the proof relies on the Cayley trick, a trick which associates to X a quasi-smooth hypersurface Y in a projective vector bundle, and the Cayley Proposition (4.3) which gives an isomorphism of some primitive cohomologies (4.2) of X and Y . The Cayley trick, following the philosophy of Mavlyutov in [7], reduces results known for quasi-smooth hypersurfaces to quasi-smooth intersection subvarieties. The idea in this paper goes the other way around, we translate some results for quasi-smooth intersection subvarieties to quasi-smooth hypersurfaces, mainly the (1, 1)-Lefschetz theorem.\\n\\nAcknowledgement.

A diﬀerential form on a complex orbifold Z is deﬁned locally at z ∈ Z as a G-invariant diﬀerential form on Cd where G ⊂ Gl(d, C) and Z is locally isomorphic to Cd/G around z.\\n\\nRoughly speaking the local geometry of orbifolds reduces to local G-invariant geometry. We have a complex of diﬀerential forms (A●(Z), d) and a double complex (A●,●(Z), ∂, ¯∂) of bigraded diﬀerential forms which deﬁne the de Rham and the Dolbeault cohomology groups (for a ﬁxed p ∈ N) respectively:\\n\\nker ¯∂ im ¯∂\\n\\nker d im d\\n\\nand H p,●(Z, ¯∂) ∶=\\n\\ndR(Z, C) ∶=\\n\\nH ●\\n\\nTheorem 2.6 (Theorem 3.4.4 in [4] and Theorem 1.2 in [1] ).

Let L1, . . . , Ls be line bundles on Pd Σ be the projective space bundle associated to the vector bundle E = L1 ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ Ls. It is known that P(E) is a (d + s − 1)-dimensional simplicial toric variety whose fan depends on the degrees of the line bundles and the fan Σ. Furthermore, if the Cox ring, without considering the grading, of Pd\\n\\nΣ and let π ∶ P(E) → Pd\\n\\nΣ is C[x1, . . . , xm] then the Cox ring of P(E) is\\n\\nC[x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , ys]\\n\\nMoreover for X a quasi-smooth intersection subvariety cut oﬀ by f1, . . . , fs with deg(fi) = [Li] we relate the hypersurface Y cut oﬀ by F = y1f1 + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + ysfs which turns out to be quasi-smooth. For more details see Section 2 in [7].\\n\\n5\\n\\nWe will denote P(E) as Pd+s−1\\n\\nΣ,X to keep track of its relation with X and Pd Σ.\\n\\nThe following is a key remark.\\n\\nRemark 4.1. There is a morphism ι ∶ X → Y ⊂ Pd+s−1 with y ≠ 0 has a preimage. Hence for any subvariety W = V(IW ) ⊂ X ⊂ Pd W ′ ⊂ Y ⊂ Pd+s−1 Σ,X such that π(W ′) = W , i.e., W ′ = {z = (x, y) ∣ x ∈ W }.\\n\\nΣ,X .

              "' Attention is All You Need is a paper published in 2017 by researchers from Google Brain. The paper introduces the Transformer, a model architecture that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, instead of using recurrence. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. Additionally, self-attention could yield more interpretable models.'"
